# Asset-Allocation


This project, conducted in May 2023, is a collaborative effort by Tommaso Lussetich and me as part of our university coursework.

We conducted a comprehensive study on asset allocation using various techniques on selected stocks from the Italian stock market. The project's Python codebase can be found in the directory, and the formal report, prepared using LaTeX, is available in the PDF file named Report.pdf.

Asset Allocation Study

Our study focuses on asset allocation strategies, aiming to optimize investment portfolios with a particular emphasis on Italian stock market assets. We have explored various techniques and methodologies to create well-diversified portfolios for better risk management and returns.

Project: This directory contains the Python codebase for our project. It encompasses all the scripts and functions used in the implementation and analysis of asset allocation strategies.

Report.pdf: The main project report, written in LaTeX, is available in this PDF file. It offers a detailed account of our project's objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions, including our research on asset allocation strategies.
